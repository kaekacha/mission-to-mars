# Mission to Mars

Hello! This is Akadia's repository for the completed homework assignment #12 for the Georgia Tech Data Science & Analytics Boot Camp. 

I've built a web application using Python and HTML langauges, web scraping and splintering, and Flask rendering. 

The final product, pictured below, scrapes multiple Mars-related websites, stores the data in a MongoDB, and displays it on an HTML page.
